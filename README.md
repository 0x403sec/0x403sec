  <h1>Hi there👋, I'm Enoch Olatunbosun</h1>
  <h3>AI Security Researcher | Penetration Tester | SOC & Detection Engineering</h3>

  <p>
    I work at the intersection of <strong>cybersecurity, offensive security, and artificial intelligence</strong>,
    focusing on how modern systems fail, and how to detect, exploit, and secure them.
  </p>

<h2>🫴 Professional Focus</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>AI Security Research</strong> : Deepfake detection, media provenance, adversarial risk analysis</li>
  <li><strong>Penetration Testing</strong> : Network, web, cloud misconfigurations, and attack simulation</li>
  <li><strong>SOC & Detection Engineering</strong> : SIEM analysis, threat detection, incident response</li>
</ul>

<p>
I approach security from both the <strong>attacker and defender perspective</strong>, combining hands-on exploitation
with monitoring, detection, and research-driven analysis.
</p>

<h2>🫴 What I’m Actively Working On</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Penetration Testing Labs</strong><br />
    Structured labs and writeups covering enumeration, exploitation, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation
    across platforms like Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and custom environments.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>AI Security & Deepfake Research</strong><br />
    Applied research on deepfake media detection, provenance analysis, and the security implications of generative AI
    in social engineering and misinformation.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Cloud & Infrastructure Security</strong><br />
    Studying real-world cloud misconfigurations, IAM weaknesses, exposed services, and attack paths in modern environments.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>SOC & Detection Engineering Skills</strong><br />
    Log analysis, alert triage, SPL searches, incident response workflows, and detection logic development.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>🫴 Research Interests</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>AI Security & Trust</strong><br />
    Deepfake detection, media provenance, adversarial manipulation, and the security implications of generative AI systems.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>AI-Driven Social Engineering & Threats</strong><br />
    Studying how AI enables scalable phishing, impersonation, and misinformation, and how to detect and mitigate it.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Cloud & Infrastructure Misconfigurations</strong><br />
    Real-world attack paths caused by insecure defaults, IAM abuse, exposed services, and poor security posture.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Offensive Security Research</strong><br />
    Translating penetration testing techniques into repeatable methodologies and detection-aware attack simulations.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Detection Engineering & SOC Analytics</strong><br />
    Building and evaluating detection logic using logs, SIEM platforms, and behavioral indicators of compromise.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
My research goal is to <strong>bridge the gap between offensive techniques, defensive detection, and AI-driven security systems</strong>,
with an emphasis on practical, real-world impact.
